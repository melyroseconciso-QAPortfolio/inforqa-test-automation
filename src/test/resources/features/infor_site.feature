  As a QA engineer
  I want to confirm the key parts of the Infor website work
  So that problems are caught before customers see them

  Scenario Outline: Key pages open without errors
    When I open the "<path>" page of the Infor website
    Then the page should load without an error

    Examples:
      | path                 |
      | /industries          |
      | /products            |
      | /platform            |
      | /customer-success    |
      | /partners            |
      | /about               |
