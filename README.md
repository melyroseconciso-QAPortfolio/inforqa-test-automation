# InforQA – Test Automation Framework

Self-initiated project to build hands-on test automation engineering skills, developed with AI assistance and run against the public Infor website.

A beginner-friendly web test automation framework, built with **Java, Selenium, Cucumber (BDD), Maven and Allure**.
It runs simple, read-only health checks against the public Infor website (https://www.infor.com).

## Features

* Page Object Model + BDD (plain-English tests in `.feature` files)
* Config-driven (website, browser, headless mode, timeouts in `config.properties`)
* Screenshot attached automatically on failure
* **Allure reports** (dashboard, charts, history, screenshots, tags)
* **Parallel execution** (3 browsers at once)
* Optional **screen video recording** and **step-by-step screenshots**

## One-time setup (about 20 minutes)

1. **Install Java 17 or higher (JDK)** – download "Temurin 21 (LTS)" from https://adoptium.net and install it (tested with Java 21).
2. **Install Maven** – https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi (or `brew install maven` on Mac, `choco install maven` on Windows).
3. **Install Google Chrome** (the framework downloads the matching driver automatically).
4. **Install a code editor** – IntelliJ IDEA Community or VS Code (with the "Extension Pack for Java").
5. Check it worked – open a terminal and run:

```
   java -version
   mvn -version
   ```

   Both should print a version number (Java 17 or higher).

## Run the tests

Open a terminal **inside this folder** and run:

```
mvn clean test
```

The first run downloads libraries, so it takes a few minutes. (`clean` removes old results first.)

|What you want|Command|
|-|-|
|Run everything (3 in parallel)|`mvn clean test`|
|Only quick checks|`mvn clean test -Dcucumber.filter.tags="@smoke"`|
|One test at a time|`mvn clean test -Dcucumber.execution.parallel.enabled=false`|
|Watch the browser|`mvn clean test -Dheadless=false -Dcucumber.execution.parallel.enabled=false`|
|Use Firefox|`mvn clean test -Dbrowser=firefox`|
|Screenshot after every step|`mvn clean test -DstepScreenshots=true`|
|Record a screen video|`mvn clean test -Dheadless=false -Drecord=true -Dcucumber.execution.parallel.enabled=false`|

## See the results

**Allure report (recommended)** – after the tests finish, run:

```
mvn allure:serve
```

A browser tab opens with the dashboard. Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal to stop the report server.
The first time, Maven downloads the Allure tool, which takes a minute.

**Simple HTML report** – open `target/cucumber-reports/report.html`.

**Videos** (only when recording is on) – `target/videos/*.avi`. These are standard AVI files that play in Windows Media Player or VLC.

## How the project is organised

```
src/test/resources/features/   <- Tests written in plain English (.feature files)
src/test/java/.../steps/       <- Java code behind each plain-English sentence, plus Hooks
src/test/java/.../pages/       <- Page Objects: how to find things on each page
src/test/java/.../core/        <- Browser start-up, settings, video recorder
src/test/java/.../runner/      <- The "start button" Maven runs
src/test/resources/config.properties         <- Website address, browser, timeouts, options
src/test/resources/junit-platform.properties <- Reports and parallel settings
```

## If a test fails

Look at the screenshot in the report, then adjust the page address in the `.feature` file
or the element locator in the matching Page Object.
Be considerate: these tests only read pages. Do not add tests that submit forms or send heavy traffic.

## Roadmap

* \[x] Phase 1-3: Framework core + BDD
* \[x] Phase 4: Allure reporting, parallel execution, screenshots and optional video
* \[ ] Phase 5: API tests with Rest Assured
* \[ ] Phase 6: Mobile (Appium) and BrowserStack
* \[ ] Phase 7: Dockerfile and GitLab CI/CD pipeline
* \[ ] Phase 8: Kubernetes/Helm Selenium Grid, UiPath bot
* \[ ] Phase 9: AI-assisted failure analysis
